      <p class="header__secondary--text1">The impacts of climate change are not distributed equally. People may have
        different
        vulnerabilities to different types of climate change impacts depending on their age, health status, location,
        access to transportation, and experience with systemic barriers wrought by discrimination. For example, an older
        adult who lives alone may have reduced social contacts, making it more difficult to find nearby cooling centers
        or
        properly attend to medical needs during heat waves. Alternatively, multiple studies have found that federal aid
        payouts after floods and other natural disasters disproportionately benefit White communities and wealthy areas,
        exacerbating wealth inequality along racial and class lines (Howell & Elliott, 2018). As such, itâ€™s important
        that
        planners, policymakers, emergency responders, and government officials center those populations and communities
        most at risk of adverse impacts when planning for climate change responses and building climate resiliency.</p>

    <p class="header__secondary--text2">This research study produces a people-centered spatial analysis of climate
      vulnerability that considers the range of inequities and risk factors that make groups vulnerable, as well as the
      types of climate change impacts that interact with those inequities and risk factors in negative ways. Such a
      framework of thinking about vulnerability is vital to develop inclusive and effective climate change interventions
      at a municipal and regional level.
